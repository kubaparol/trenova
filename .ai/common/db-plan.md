# Trenova PostgreSQL Database Schema (MVP)

This document outlines the PostgreSQL database schema for the Trenova MVP, based on the PRD and planning session decisions.

## 1. ENUM Types

These custom types ensure data consistency for predefined choices.

```sql
-- ENUM types related to user profiles removed as profile feature is deprecated.
-- Defines the possible training goals for a user
-- CREATE TYPE public.user_goal AS ENUM (...);

-- Defines the possible experience levels of a user
-- CREATE TYPE public.experience_level AS ENUM (...);

-- Defines the types of equipment access a user might have
-- CREATE TYPE public.equipment_access AS ENUM (...);

-- Defines the gender options for a user profile
-- CREATE TYPE public.user_gender AS ENUM (...);
```

## 2. Tables

### 2.2. `training_plans`

Stores the training plans generated for users. Linked many-to-one with `auth.users`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.training_plans (
  id uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), -- Unique identifier for the plan
  user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- User who owns the plan, cascades deletes
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

  -- Plan Details
  name text NOT NULL, -- Name of the training plan (e.g., "My Plan - 2024-07-27")
  description text NOT NULL, -- Description of the training plan
  plan_details jsonb NOT NULL -- The structured workout plan (days, exercises, sets, reps, rest) generated by AI
  -- preferences_snapshot jsonb NOT NULL -- Removed: Snapshot of user preferences is no longer stored
);

-- Add comments to the table and columns for clarity
COMMENT ON TABLE public.training_plans IS 'Stores AI-generated training plans for users.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.training_plans.user_id IS 'The user associated with this training plan.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.training_plans.name IS 'User-editable name for the training plan.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.training_plans.description IS 'User-editable description for the training plan.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.training_plans.plan_details IS 'JSONB structure containing the detailed workout schedule and exercises.';
-- COMMENT ON COLUMN public.training_plans.preferences_snapshot IS 'Removed: JSONB snapshot of key user preferences used to generate this specific plan.';

```

## 3. Relationships

- **`training_plans` to `auth.users`**: Many-to-One. Established via `training_plans.user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.

## 4. Indexes

In addition to the default Primary Key indexes and potential Foreign Key indexes created by PostgreSQL/Supabase:

```sql
-- Optimizes fetching the most recent plans for a specific user
CREATE INDEX idx_training_plans_user_created_at
ON public.training_plans (user_id, created_at DESC);
```

## 5. Row Level Security (RLS)

RLS is enabled to ensure users can only access and modify their own data.

```sql
-- Enable RLS for profiles and training_plans tables
-- ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; -- Removed
ALTER TABLE public.training_plans ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant all actions to the anon and authenticated roles initially (policies will restrict)
-- Supabase typically handles initial grants, but ensuring they exist.
-- Adjust roles as necessary for your Supabase setup if not using standard 'anon' and 'authenticated'.
-- GRANT ALL ON TABLE public.profiles TO anon, authenticated; -- Removed
GRANT ALL ON TABLE public.training_plans TO anon, authenticated;


-- Policies for 'profiles' table -- Removed
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow individual user access to own profile" ON public.profiles;
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow individual user access to own profile" ...;

-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow individual user update access to own profile" ON public.profiles;
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow individual user update access to own profile" ...;


-- Policies for 'training_plans' table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow individual user access to own plans" ON public.training_plans;
CREATE POLICY "Allow individual user access to own plans"
ON public.training_plans
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## 6. Triggers and Functions

These automate certain database operations.

## 7. Additional Considerations

- **Data Validation:** Input validation (e.g., for `plan_details` structure) should primarily occur at the application/API layer before insertion. Database constraints (`CHECK`) provide a baseline integrity check.
- **`plan_details` JSONB Structure:** While the exact structure isn't defined here, it's expected to be consistent (e.g., `{"day1": [{"exercise": "Push-up", "sets": 3, "reps": 10, "rest_seconds": 60}, ...], "day2": ...}`). The application layer is responsible for generating and parsing this structure.
- **Admin Access:** For MVP, administrative access (e.g., for support) is intended to be handled outside the application's RLS, likely directly via Supabase Studio or specific admin roles/policies if implemented later.
- **Default Plan Name:** The application backend is responsible for generating a sensible default name for `training_plans.name` upon creation (e.g., "Plan - {created_at::date})").
